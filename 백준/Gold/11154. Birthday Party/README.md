### 문제 설명

<p>N persons have been invited to a somewhat special birthday party. Each person brings one present, but the recipent of each present is determined randomly. A person never receives his own present, but all other persons are equally likely recipients. What is the probability that one can find k persons at the party such that person 1 gives his present to person 2, person 2 gives his present to person 3 and so on to person k which gives his present to person 1?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers N and k.</p>

<ul>
	<li>0 < T ≤ 30</li>
	<li>2 ≤ N ≤ 10000000</li>
	<li>2 ≤ k ≤ N</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output the probability with an accuracy of at least 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
